# Manga-Viewer
This little application goes to a manga hosting website (in this case mangapanda.com) and parses the webpage using the JSoup API in order to display the top manga section onto a GUI I created using JavaFx. It also allows the user to then read any of the mangas displayed using images found on the website. All images are the property of mangapanda.com .
